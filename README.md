# SLD(Stress level detect)app
Project of Discovering stress recognition by faial expressions

The aim of the project is to detect stress levels by analysing facial expressions to prevent consequences such as overloading, depression, and burning out. 
Since the modern rhythm of the life often causes overloading and stress, the SLD intelligent assistant was created to prevent the negative consequences of excessive stress.
The project's goal is to create a software product that can analyse stress levels by facial expressions, which will help prevent the negative consequences of excessive stress (depression, burning out, overwork, etc.). In addition to analysis, the project aims to develop recommendations or signals for timely intervention by teachers, psychologists, or managers in cases where stress levels are excessive. This will prevent emotional burning out, reduce the risk of conflicts, and ensure  comfortable atmosphere in a team.
The overall objective of the product is to help maintain the psychological well-being of a person and create  safe environment where the negative effects of stress will be minimized.

The novelty lies in the use of a neural network to determine the level of stress by analyzing a photo or video stream received from a webcam.   
The program code of the application for analyzing the level of stress is implemented in Python using libraries for image processing and neural networks, which ensures high accuracy of the program. The application is ready to use and has been tested on a local dataset.
